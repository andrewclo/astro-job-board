## Deployment Strategy

This project uses a branch-based deployment strategy:

- **main**: Development branch where all development work happens
- **production**: Deployment branch that triggers the GitHub Pages build and deployment

### Workflow

1. Develop and commit changes to the `main` branch
2. When ready to deploy, merge changes from `main` to `production`:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're on the main branch
   git checkout main
   
   # Pull the latest changes
   git pull origin main
   
   # Checkout the production branch
   git checkout production
   # (Create it first if it doesn't exist: git checkout -b production)
   
   # Merge changes from main
   git merge main
   
   # Push to production
   git push origin production
   ```

3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `production` branch.

4. You can also manually trigger a deployment from the GitHub Actions tab by running the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow.
